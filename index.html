    <h3>What is the AAHW?</h3>
	<p>The AAHW (Agency Against Hank Wimbleton) is an organization founded and led by the Auditor with the immediate goal of eliminating <a href="https://madnesscombat.fandom.com/wiki/Hank_J._Wimbleton">Hank J. Wimbleton</a> and his associates to restore law and order to Nevada.</p>
	<h3>Why Hank?</h3>
	<p>Hank J. Wimbleton is a menace who is responsible for numerous crimes including killing countless civilians and soldiers and causing Nevada to be plundered into chaos. 
	He is a highly skilled mercenary with superhuman strength and abilities, and it will take the force of many trained soldiers to permanently defeat him.</p>

	<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
	<p>Salaries start at $6 per week depending on rank, and when Hank J. Wimbleton is defeated and our cause goes unopposed, we will throw a pizza party.</p>
	<h3>How do I apply?</h3>
	<p>The applicant must perform the following steps:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Be in Nevada.</li>
	<li>Submit your application <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/series/madness">here</a> or contact your local recruiter.</li>
